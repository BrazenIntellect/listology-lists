# Old Listology music lists
A selection of some old Listology lists, since Listology is (sadly) offline because of a server outage some time ago. Listology was home to the legendary (and somewhat controversial) top 400 trance songs list of Darktremor. This list REALLY got me interested in trance music and kickstarted more amazing top X music lists. Over the past few years, I've downloaded some of theses lists which I want to share here.
