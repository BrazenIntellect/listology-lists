# Best hardcore songs (by ?)

By this I mean all the best Hardcore from the era of 90-93, when Hardcore had its peak (as from after that, a huge decline occoured in quality and new terrible genres emerged). The genres being accepted into this are; Rave & Mentasm Hardcore (Joey Beltram) & Oldskool Breakbeat Hardcore (Acen). New Beat is too small a genre to be accepted, and sounds too different from the other two. Suggestions are more than welcome!
.
Instruments/Sounds Used in Classic Hardcore;
.
The Mentasm (The Hoover): The Roland Alpha Juno 2 synthesizer created this monumental sound (labelled on the synth as the “WhatThe?” style), using LFOs (low-frequency oscillations) and pulse-width modulations to create the thick, swirly, gluey, hypnotic sound that you will hear countless times in classic hardcore. Featured heavily in: Second Phase - Mentasm
.
Acid: The Roland TB-303 created this phenomenal (and hugely used) synth sound mainly by accident, as it was intended to sound like a bass guitar (which it doesn’t, at all). It has been described as squelchy, trippy, hypnotic and countless other psychedelic adjectives, and has been used in nearly every single genre existent today. Featured heavily in: Altern 8 – Armageddon
.
Breakbeat/Jungle Samples: These are beat which have been cut up and spliced in many different ways to make beats for songs, usually from samples (such as the Amen Break, or Funky Drummer) and then sped up to suit the music. Featured heavily in: Acen – Trip II the Moon (All parts)
.
Vocal Samples: These usually aren’t the people who make the song’s voices, or anyone even vaguely affiliated with them, just random vocals sampled (stolen) from famous television programmes, films and more mainstream popular music. And despite being the loveable audio pirates that they are, the people who get sampled sometimes get quite annoyed and sue said artist (Acen was sued by the Beatles for sampling George Harrison’s “Here comes the sun” vocal on Close Your Eyes (Original Mix). Usually these samples are left as they are, but sometimes are “chipmunked” (made extremely high) or deepened greatly.
.
Misc. Samples: In classic hardcore, sampling each other’s work was commonplace (especially in Oldskool Breakbeat Hardcore), some of the best songs on here just blatantly rip off songs, and just add to them further. Nebula II – Anthema is an insane Oldskool Breakbeat hardcore song, with two main melodies, one being a sped up and distorted version of the main melody from LFO – LFO, but in context it fits perfectly.
.
And so to the list itself…
